# About my Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! 
Here I have organized a collection of projects I have worked on in my free time to expand my data analyst skills.
I am proficient in RStudio, SQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau. I am confident in the use of these applications as well as the
organization, presentation, and visualizations required when delivering said analysis. 

Each project here was done in my free time with my own general interests. I have a passion for nutrition and health data and center a lot of my work around data of this kind.
Each project demonstrates my knowledge and ability to use applications for thorough analysis and organization.

# Projects
### Data Analysis and Exploration Projects
[Uber Rides Data Analytics](https://github.com/hannahdpeterson/Data_Portfolio/tree/main/Uber%20Rides%20Data%20-%20Data%20Exploration)
Data obtained via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashdevladdha/uber-ride-analytics-dashboard/data)
* Data contains 148770 bookings
* Provides date, time, ID's, vehicle types, driving completion, etc
* Used data to display understanding of the process of analysis, appropriate statistical methods for evaluation, and what to look for when given raw data.

### Scraping Sites for Use on Tableau and Power BI
[Scraping Sites for Data](https://github.com/hannahdpeterson/Data_Portfolio/tree/main/Scraping_Sets)
I have a longer project using a scrape of the top gainers and losers in the stock market, adding the new gainers and losers with updated numbers daily to my data frame for use and exploration for power BI and tableau projects, respectively. The stock market data comes from [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/). My r.script for the collection and scraping process for losing stocks of the day is here: 
[Loser Stocks](https://github.com/hannahdpeterson/Data_Portfolio/blob/main/Scraping_Sets/Stock_Losers.R) 
and my gaining stocks are here:
[Gainer Stocks](https://github.com/hannahdpeterson/Data_Portfolio/blob/main/Scraping_Sets/Stock_Gainers.R)

As you can see, simple scrape, but the addition to a data frame overtime allows for insights and exploration as to which stocks appear the most often, what patterns can be seen, and changes specifically made in the market. If you would like to view the current data I have collected so far:
Both Files contain the Dates, Symbol, Company, Rank, Percent Change, Price, Volume, and Market Cap.

I have also added fun scrapes just to show a little more versatality: A scrape of protein bars prices, flavor and brand coming from GNC:
[Protein Bar Scrape](https://github.com/hannahdpeterson/Data_Portfolio/blob/main/Scraping_Sets/gnc_scrape.R) and the data frame: [GNC Data](https://github.com/hannahdpeterson/Data_Portfolio/blob/main/Scraping_Sets/gnc2_clean.csv)
and a scrape from a popular free-watch anime site: [Anime Scrape](https://github.com/hannahdpeterson/Data_Portfolio/blob/main/Scraping_Sets/quick_anime_site_scrape.R)
