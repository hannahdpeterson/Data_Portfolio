# About my Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! 
Here I have organized a collection of projects I have worked on in my free time to expand my data analyst skills.
I am proficient in RStudio, SQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau. I am confident in the use of these applications as well as the
organization, presentation, and visualizations required when delivering said analysis. 

Each project here was done in my free time with my own general interests. I have a passion for nutrition and health data and center a lot of my work around data of this kind.
Each project demonstrates my knowledge and ability to use applications for thorough analysis and organization.
